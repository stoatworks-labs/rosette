/**
	The audio side: a spectrum in, a level and an onset out.

	Adapted from macroblock's analyser, which has been driven with real music
	through Resolume's FFT buffer. Rosette needs less of it than macroblock
	does -- one band, no mode dropdown -- so what remains is the full-range
	envelope for the continuous shake and the onset detector for the kicks.

	**Where the audio comes from.** FFGL has no audio path. What Resolume
	provides is a buffer parameter declared `FF_USAGE_FFT`, which the host
	fills with a 64-bin spectrum once per frame -- a *modulation* source at
	video rate, not a signal source, so the smallest interval this can
	resolve is a frame and a kick lands on the frame after the transient.

	**Normalised against its own recent peak**, so the same Audio Drive means
	the same swing on a quiet stem and a mastered track. The cost is that a
	long loud passage reads as "1" throughout, because relative to the last
	few seconds it is.
