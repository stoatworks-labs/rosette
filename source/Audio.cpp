	// every one-pole below snaps rather than filters, so `fluxMean` takes
	// that whole number as its adaptive floor. The bar is then several times
	// any real onset and decays with a one-second time constant, which
	// leaves the detector DEAF for about a second and a half.
	//
	// It is not a harness artefact: it happens in the host every time audio
	// starts, a clip is triggered, or the analyser is reset -- exactly the
	// moments an operator is watching for the first kick. Measured on the
	// harness's own feed before the fix: a bar of 1.44 against hits of 0.48,
	// and 1 onset detected in the first two seconds instead of 3.
