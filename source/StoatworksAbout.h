/*
 * Stoatworks Labs - About window data for Rosette.
 *
 * PROVISIONAL, hand-written in the shape stoatworks-backend/scripts/sync-about.py
 * generates, exactly as graticule's was. Rosette is not yet registered in the
 * website's projects.json, so the sync cannot produce this file; once it is,
 * `sync-about.py --only rosette --apply` overwrites this with the generated
 * copy. The facts below are the ones that registration will carry, so the
 * parameter count -- which depends on how many links are present -- does not
 * change when it does.
 *
 * `guide` is deliberately empty: there is no user guide yet, and a link that
 * is not written is left out rather than shown as a button that opens a 404.
